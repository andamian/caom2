Design decision: keep ProductType vocabulary instead of adopting the IVOA DataLink semantics vocabulary because the latter is
a much more general description of the relationship between a resource (artifact) and the product (plane). In CAOM, the
ProductType describes what an Artifact or Part *is*, not how it relates to the Plane; the relation to the Plane is always
"is a component of" the plane.

Changes:

added ProductType.THUMBNAIL, name and serialised value TBD?

added ReleaseType enum (values: DATA, META)

mandatory Artifact.productType (was: optional), default: SCIENCE?
- default+warn needed in code so that current code can read old observations with 
  Artifact.productType=null; will remove the default value in the next version

added mandatory Artifact.releaseType, default: DATA

removed Artifact.alternative (was: optional, ambiguous, never used)

changed Part->Chunk relation from 0..* to 0..1
removed Chunk.productType
- Chunk is now "description of a data array in the part" and not one of the "subsections of the array"
- ObservableAxis will need to be generalised to descibe the whole axis (all Slices) and not just a single Slice

model changes implemented in CAOM-2.2.xsd

added computed Plane metadata (position, energy, time, polarization) structures to CAOM-2.2.xsd
